## Business Understanding

The objective of this project is to create a way to predict severity of car accidents happening based on road and weather conditions so that drivers can adapt their behavior, e.g. drive more carefully or even avoid travelling at at risk conditions all together.
That is, our algorithm needs to take as input the conditions that may impact severity of accidents:

* road conditions
* weather conditions
* lighting conditions
etc.

and predict the risk profile of potential accidents, i.e. the severity label. A user should then be able to specify the current conditions
of their itinerary and should then get back the severity label of accidents happening.



<!--- The initial phase is to understand the project's objective from the business or application perspective. Then, you need to translate this knowledge into a machine learning problem with a preliminary plan to achieve the objectives.-->
