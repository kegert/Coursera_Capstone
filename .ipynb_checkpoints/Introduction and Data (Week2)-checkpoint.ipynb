    "# Car accident severity predictor\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of this project is to create a way to predict severity of car accidents happening based on road and weather conditions.\n",
    "That is, our algorithm needs to take as input the conditions that may impact severity of accidents:\n",
    "\n",
    "* road conditions\n",
    "* weather conditions\n",
    "* lighting conditions\n",
    "\n",
    "and predict the risk profile of potential accidents, i.e. the severity label. A user should then be able to specify the current conditions\n",
    "of their itinerary and should then get back the severity label of accidents happening.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main stakeholders are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* __traffic regulators__: They can make policies (e.g. speed limits, higher controls etc) in order to mitigate risks.\n",
    "* __drivers__: They can recognize risks in advance and adapt their behavior in order to lower their own personal risks, e.g. drive more carefully or even avoid travelling at at risk conditions all together.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Data understanding \n",
    "\n",
    "The given data set contains all collisions provided by Seattle police departement and recorded by Traffic Records. The level of aggregation is\n",
    "weekly. The timeframe is 2004 to today.\n",
    "(See metadata from the SPD Collision data set.)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Label\n",
    "We need to predict severity of the accident given by the data colum 'SEVERITYCODE'. The following codes are given:\n",
    "\n",
    "* 3—fatality \n",
    "* 2b—serious injury\n",
    "* __2—injury__\n",
    "* __1—property damage__\n",
    "* 0—unknown\n",
    "\n",
    "Only labels of 1,2 are present in the dataset. Furthermore, these categories are unbalanced\n",
    "\n",
    "| SEVERITYCODE | Occurences |\n",
    "| -- | -- |\n",
    "| 1 | 136485 |\n",
    "| 2 | 58188  | \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Features\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to predict the label, our severity code, we will use the following colums as features.\n",
    "\n",
    "* 'WEATHER' containing data on the weather such at if it was dry or wet etc.\n",
    "* 'ROADCOND' containing information whether the road was dry, wet etc.\n",
    "* 'LIGHTCOND' containing data on lighting, e.g. if it was dark.\n",

    "## 3. Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "### Preprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "To mitigate the label unbalancedness, we will downsample the first category to have exactly the same number of \n",
    "occurences.\n",
    "\n",
    "Secondly, we need to take out the value=Unknown for the features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thirdly, we need to convert the features into numerical values in order for the algorithms to work.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Machine learning models\n",
    "\n",
    "The following models will be employed:\n",
    "\n",
    "* __k-nearest neighbors__ This algorithm will assign a label to an unknown feature set based on the labels of its k closest neighbors, where closeness is defined as closest to the features.\n",
    "\n",
    "* __decision trees__ This algorithm will find criteria on the features organized in a tree like way in order to predict the right label category.\n",
    "\n",
    "* __logistic regression__ Here, we model the probability of a feature set to result in either category. This algorithm is designed for binary decision problems, which is the case for this data set and the posed question.\n",
